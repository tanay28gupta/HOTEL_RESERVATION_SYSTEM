# HOTEL_RESERVATION_SYSTEM
Most of the people in this world like to travel from one place to another no matter whether it 
is a small or large distance. The need for a tourism management system that can manage 
tourism information with ease is sought after by every tour management company. Tour 
Management system is a dynamic website for tourism business. This travel and tourism 
application is designed for travel agencies by which they can manage different tour packages 
based on the destinations. By using this, the tour company can tailor tour packages spanning 
various destinations at almost every price point. The also implemented search module allows 
the administrator to find and update or upgrade the tour packages with ease. This module can 
also even be extended to a customer application page by which customers can find the right 
tour package for them at every budget, depending on the tour locations. The main purpose is 
to help tourism companies to manage tour packages. The system can also be used for both 
professional and business trips. The proposed system maintains a centralized repository to 
make necessary travel arrangements and to retrieve information easily. 

This project “TRAVEL AND TOURISM MANAGEMENT” is used to automate all processes 
of travel and tourism, which deals with creation, booking and confirmation and user details. 
The coding language used C++ and UML diagrams. Travel and tourism management system 
is used to book a tour from anywhere in the world by a single dynamic website which will help 
the user to know all about the places and tour details in a single website. The admin can add 
packages to the website from certain travel agents and hotels by creating a tour page. Then the 
users can sign in and book each project, they can be confirmed by the admin in the managed 
booking page. The user can see the confirmation in my booking page. It is the easiest platform 
for all travellers which can be easily booked and know the all details.
